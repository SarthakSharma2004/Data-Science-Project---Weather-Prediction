Weather prediction plays a crucial role in numerous sectors, including agriculture, transportation, tourism, and disaster management. Accurate forecasting enables stakeholders to make informed decisions and mitigate risks associated with weather-related events. However, predicting weather conditions with precision remains a challenging task due to the dynamic and complex nature of atmospheric phenomena.

The problem addressed in this project is the prediction of weather conditions specifically at 3 PM in the city of Melbourne, Australia. Melbourne, known for its diverse and often unpredictable weather patterns, presents a significant challenge for accurate weather forecasting. The task involves utilizing machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model capable of forecasting weather conditions at this specific time of the day.
The technical implementation of the weather prediction project in Melbourne revolves around leveraging Python as the primary programming language within the Jupyter Notebook environment. Python's versatility, rich ecosystem of libraries, and ease of use make it a natural choice for such data-driven projects. Jupyter Notebook, with its interactive and collaborative features, provides an ideal platform for exploratory data analysis, model development, and documentation.

For data preprocessing tasks, the project relies on the Pandas library, a powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis. Pandas facilitates various data preprocessing operations, including loading datasets, cleaning data, handling missing values, and transforming data into a suitable format for model training. Leveraging Pandas streamlines the preprocessing pipeline, allowing for efficient data wrangling and preparation.

As for the core machine learning model used in the project, the team has opted for NeuralProphet. NeuralProphet is a time-series forecasting library built on top of PyTorch, specifically designed to handle complex temporal patterns and capture non-linear relationships in time-series data. Its neural network architecture enables it to learn from historical weather data and make accurate predictions for future time points, making it well-suited for the task of weather forecasting at 3 PM in Melbourne.
